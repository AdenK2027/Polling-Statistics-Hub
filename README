Hello, here is a table of contents for future navigational purposes

analytics.py --> holds all of the code that parses data held in the Individual class and counts it
    all up before turning it to percentages

end_formatting.py --> formats the data for each section into human readable data and adds it to
    a string that is held in gui.py

gui.py --> creates the gui that allows you to select a file as well as stores the string to be
    written by write_data.py, and runs both end_formatting.py abd write_data.py (serves as Main)

individual.py --> class created to store each line of data from the raw polling data (stores each
    individual as their email, party, response, etc)

polling_data --> grabs the raw polling data and converts it into a list of Individual class items
    (IF DATA IS BEING READ INCORRECTLY CHECK HERE)

write_data --> takes the string created by end_formatting.py and formats/writes it to your
    downloads folder
